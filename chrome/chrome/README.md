# Zoom Browser
A simple chrome extension that makes visiting Zoom meeting links take you to the Zoom browser version by skipping past popups to use the Desktop app.

I've submitted this to the Chrome Web Store, but it's still pending review. For now, to install, run `git clone https://github.com/404wolf/zoom-browser.git`, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode, and click "Load unpacked" to select the folder you cloned the repo to.
